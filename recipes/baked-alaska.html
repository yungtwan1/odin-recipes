                <h2><em>What is Baked Alaska?</em></h2>
                    <p>Baked Alaska is a baked dessert consisting of cake, ice cream, and meringue. 
                    
                        So how does the ice cream not melt during the baking process? 
                    
                        The meringue insulates it from the heat. The treat is baked in a hot oven for a few minutes or just long enough to firm and brown the meringue.</p>
